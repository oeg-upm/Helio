## Helio, lift your data!

Helio is a framework that allows generating and publishing RDF data from different heterogeneous sources as Linked Data. 

## What Helio can do for me?

As user Helio can be used to generate synchronously or asynchronously Knowledge Graphs from a set of heterogeneous sources:
* Generating the RDF of the KG into a file
* Link resources using linking rules
* Use different mapping languages to generate RDF and links among its resources
* Use an external triple store as Helio database
* Publish the RDF as a Linked Data Service (prividing access to resources, a SPARQL endpoint, and the whole dataset)
* Customise the HTML views of the Linked Data Service
* Create views dynamically combining data of different RDF resources
* Provide an integrated view of different distributed Helios or SPARQL endpoints

As a developer Helio can be used as a maven dependency for:
* Generating RDF and links among resources
* Develop plugins for new functionalities
